# Fitness Tracker

A simple React + TypeScript application to display a userâ€™s exercise data for the past week.  
The app shows a table view of exercise data (calories burned, steps taken) and a chart visualization of the same data.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Load exercise data from a local JSON file (no APIs required).
- Display the data in a **styled table**.
- Visualize **calories and steps trends** in a line chart.
- Clean, modern styling with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Responsive layout (table and chart side-by-side on larger screens).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
``` git clone https://github.com/YashPShah2001/fitness-tracker.git ```

2. Install dependencies:
``` npm install ```

3. Run the app:
``` npm run dev ```

4. Open the brower at:
``` http://localhost:5173 ```

## Data
The data is stored locally in exerciseData.json:
``` 
[
  { "date": "2025-08-01", "calories": 450, "durationMinutes": 40 },
  { "date": "2025-08-02", "calories": 320, "durationMinutes": 30 },
  { "date": "2025-08-03", "calories": 600, "durationMinutes": 55 },
  { "date": "2025-08-04", "calories": 290, "durationMinutes": 25 },
  { "date": "2025-08-05", "calories": 500, "durationMinutes": 45 }
] 
```
`Steps` are derived from `durationMinutes x 100`.
